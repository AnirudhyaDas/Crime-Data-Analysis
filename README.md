# Description
The crime dataset that we chose has real data and is acquired from UCI Machine Learning repository where the title of the dataset is 'crime_data'. The dataset has large number of numerical columns which was the main reason for choosing such a dataset rather than a categorical one because it makes is easy to apply algorithms and avoids the hassle of conversion of categorical data to numerical data. The crime attributes in the dataset that could be predicted by applying various machine learning algorithms as considered are Rape, Murder, Larceny, Robbery, Assault, Burglaries, Autotheft and Arsons.
